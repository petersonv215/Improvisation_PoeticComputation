## Improvisation as Poetic Computation

Parsons code is apt for studying and comparing the internal structure of songs, i.e. how sound is organized to communicate a thought. Choose a key and encode a tone with the symbol `*` =start, `U`=Up, `D`=Down, or `R`=Repeat in that key to describe the internal structure of that song, i.e. how sound should be organized to communicate the concept (=song) encoded by the melodic contour described using those symbols. From this, a process can be developed whereby the act of organizing sound provides a model for how people organize around the structure encoded by, i.e. the mood of, that song across contexts.

Notes: 


James Weldon Johnson's (JWJ) songbook was transcribed into Parsons code using `MuseScore Parsons Code Exporter 1.0` from .mxml scores of the songs collected in the JWJ volume. This was done to maintain consistency throughout the translation process. Singing books, in which music was treated as a textual archive, was produced by a machine trained on the Burkimsher and JWJ datasets. 

“Songbooks," i.e. singing texts, were generated using DeepAI’s `GPT-3 text generator`. To model improvisation, after training our text generator we used as input an encoding of the “kernel” phrase James Weldon Johnson identified in the introduction to his book. This kernel was determined as the generative core of the music emanating from the Americas after the introduction of slaves to both continents and the Caribbean and found in the work songs, spirituals, and eventually the blues. From this core, and modeled by the GPT, we simulated the evolution of blues from spirituals, to jazz, and other genres: Rhythm and Blues, Rock and Roll, etc. This kernel phrase is the following: 



`*UDRRUDRR` or `*RRRRRUD`
