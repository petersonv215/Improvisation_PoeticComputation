## Improvisation as Poetic Computation: James Weldon Johnson and Sonic Text Archive

Parsons code is apt for studying and comparing the internal structure of songs. Choose a key, encode with *, U=Up, D=Down, R=Repeat, a tone in that key. From this, a process can be developed whereby the act of organizing sound provides a model for how people organize around the structure encoded by, the mood, or that song across contexts.

Notes: 


James Weldon Johnson (JWJ) songbook was transcribed into Parsons code using MuseScore Parsons Code Exporter 1.0 from .mxml scores in order to maintain consistency. GPT data was produced by a machine trained on the Burkimsher and JWJ datasets. 

“Songbooks” were generated using deepAI’s GPT3. To model improvisation, after training our input was an encoding of the “kernel” phrase James Weldon Johnson identified in the introduction to his book as the generative core to the music emanating from the Americas after the introduction of slaves and found in the blues. From this core, and modeled by the GPT, we simulated the evolution of blues from spirituals, to jazz, and other genres: Rhythm and Blues, Rock and Roll, etc. This kernel phrase is the following: 



`*UDRRUDRR` or `*RRRRRUD`
