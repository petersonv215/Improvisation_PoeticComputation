"* This category is purposefully problematized for the simple reason that the global outreach of media and culture from the U.S. means that the vast majority of these songs were played at protests in other parts of the globe. It has long been theorized, with evidence, (see Jones [Baraka], Blue People; von Eschen, Satchmo Blows Up the World, et al) that US culture is Black American culture without full Black participation in the economic and political benefit.
